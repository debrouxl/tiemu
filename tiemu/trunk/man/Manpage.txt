NAME
       tiemu - a TI's hand-helds emulator (m68k-based)

SYNOPSYS
       tiemu [-h] [-v] [--help] [--version] [--import] [-rom=] [-tib=] [-sav=]
       [image]

DESCRIPTION
       The TiEmu program allows you to emulate a Texas Instruments  calculator
       such  as TI89, TI89 Titanium, TI92, TI92+ or V200PLT.  The emulator has
       also a virtual link capability which allows to connect  it  to  another
       program (such as TiLP for instance).

OPTIONS
       The command line options override the default options (startup options)
       and the config file options even.  The TiEmu program accepts  the  fol-
       lowing options:

       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.

       -v, --version
              Output the version info.

       --import=
              Import ROM or TIB into repository and exit. Can be used for cre-
              ating images (as an example).  This flag must be set before -rom
              or -tib !

       -rom=  Convert and use the specified dump as image. Note that the image
              is added to the image repository.

       -tib=  Convert and use the specified tib/upgrade as image. Idem.

       -sav=  Load the specified state file. Must be a valid state  image  and
              target for emulated calculator.


CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This section describes the format of the .tiemu config file which is in
       the home directory of the user (Linux) or in the Program  Files  folder
       (Win32). A line preceded by the '#' symbol is a comment.  Each line has
       the following  format:  key=value.   The  config  file  must  have  the
       'RC_END'  string  at end.  Every line can be put in any order.  Take in
       mind that any comment added in the config  file  will  be  overwritten.
       Below is described each option and the possible values:

       calctype=  Defines the calculator type for link parameter. Valid values
       are: ti89, ti89t, ti92, ti92+, v200.  Note: don't need  to  touch  this
       setting, it's overridden by TiEmu. Kept for compatibility.

       linktype=  Define  the  link  cable  type.  Choose one of the following
       value: none, parallel, serial, TIGraphLink, virtual,  TiEmulator,  VTi,
       UsbGraphLink.

       port=  Define  a  link  port  to use. Can be: null, user, parallel port
       #1|2|3, serial port #1|2|3|4, virtual port #1|2, USB port #1.

       method= Define an I/O method to use. Possible  values  are:  automatic,
       asm, api, driver, null.

       adr_port=  places  the  I/O  address  of the I/O port to use. It can be
       0x3F8 for a serial port or 0x378 for a parallel port for instance.

       serial_device= places the character device name of the serial  port  to
       use with a Grey TIGL.

       timeout=  with  the  timeout  value to use in tenth of seconds. Default
       value: 20.

       delay= with the delay value  to  use  in  micro-seconds  for  home-made
       cables. Default value: 10

       background= Define whether TiEmu display the whole frame (keyboard+LCD)
       or just the LCD screen. Set to 0 if you do not want  to  use  the  key-
       board.

       skin_file=  Define  the  custom  skin  file to use. Must be a full path
       name.

       keys_file= Define the keymap to use. Must be a full path name.

       img_file= Define the TiEmu image to load at startup.  Must  be  a  full
       path name.

       tib_file= Define the FLASH upgrade (tib or .9xu/.89u) to load after the
       image. Must be a full path name.

       sav_file= Define the calculator state image to load at startup.

       cpu_rate= Give the number of instructions executed by  the  M68000  per
       30ms timeslice. Default value is -1 (50000 insts/30ms).

       hw_rate= Give the OS2/OSC3 oscillator rate. Default value is -1 (427 on
       hw1 and 732 on hw2; OSC2 is incremented every 6250 OSC1 cycles).

       lcd_rate= Define the frame rate of LCD refresh.  Default  value  is  -1
       (25ms => 40fps). Don't use a value smaller than 10ms.

       img_format=  Defines  the image format of the screenshots. Several for-
       mats are available: jpg, png and ico.

       img_type= You can do B/W (bw) or colored (color) screenshots.

       img_size= The size of the image that is to say you can shots  only  the
       LCD (lcd) or the entire window (skin).

       screen_file=  Defines  the  base  filename where the screenshot will be
       stored.

       screen_counter= This allows you to save the current screenshot counter.
       In   fact,   the   resulting   filename   is   computed   as   'screen-
       file[screen_counter].[img_format]. Example: 'screenshot001.png'.

       console= Available under Windows platform only. You can  hide  (no)  or
       show  (yes)  the  DOS console at startup or even display it only during
       boot (boot).

       kbd_dbg= Display key bindings in the console if  set  (yes).  Else,  do
       nothing (no).

       fs_type=  TiEmu supports several file selectors for better integration.
       The following options are supported:
       - native: native one (default): Win32 on Windows, KDE if built with KDE
       support and running under KDE, GTK+ 2.x else,
       - old: GTK 1.2 file selector,
       - new: GTK 2.x file selector (advanced capabilities and can show hidden
       files),
       - win32: deprecated (same as native),
       - kde: KDE file selector (only available if TiEmu  is  built  with  KDE
       support).

       bkpts_wnd=
       code_wnd=
       mem_wnd=
       regs_wnd=
       pclog_wnd=
       stack_wnd=
       heap_wnd= Set geometry hints for the different windows of the debugger.
       The format is (x,y,w,h,m,v) where x&y  are  coordinates,  w&h  are  the
       size,  m  is  set  if window is minimized and v is set if the window is
       open.

       Think to terminate your config script with the 'RC_END' word !!!
