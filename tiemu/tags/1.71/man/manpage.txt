DESCRIPTION
       The GtkTiEmu program allows you to emulate a Texas Instru-
       ments calculators such as a TI89, TI92 or  TI92+  calcula-
       tor.   The  emulator  has  also  a virtual link capability
       which allows to connect it to another program (such  as  a
       linking program for instance).

OPTIONS
       The  command  line  options  override  the default options
       (startup options) and the config file options  even.   The
       GtkTiEmu accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.

       -v, --version
              Output the version info.

       -rom_file=
              Load  the  specified  ROM  file.  Must  be  a valid
              TI89/92/92+ ROM image.

       -ram_file=
              Load the  specified  RAM  file.  Must  be  a  valid
              TI89/92/92+ RAM image.

       -calc= Select a calculator type: ti92+, ti92, ti89.

       -link= Select  a  link cable type: Grey TIGraphLink (tgl),
              home-made serial or Black TIGraphLink (ser),  home-
              made   parallel   link  (par),  fastAVRlink  (avr),
              generic virtual link (vtl), TIEmulator virtual link
              (tie), VTi virtual link (vti), TI/PC USB link (tpu)
              or USB TIGraphLink (ugl).

       -adr_port=
              This value can represent either a  direct  address,
              either  a  link  number/mode, according to the link
              type.  Give the direct address of the parallel port
              (0x3BC,  0x378  or  0x278)  or  serial port (0x3F8,
              0x2F8, 0x3E8 or 0x2E8), depending of the link cable
              type.   Give the link number of the virtual link (1
              -> #0, 2 -> #1).  Give the link mode of  the  TI/PC
              USB link (1 -> 'raw' mode, 2 -> 'cooked' mode).

       -dev_port=
              Give  the  serial port device (/dev/ttyS[0..3]) for
              the Grey TIGraphLink or the fastAVRlink.

       -timeout=
              in tenth of seconds (0.1 s). This is the time while
              the program wait a response of the calculator. Once
              this delay elapsed, the program  send  a  time  out
              error. The default value is 1 seconds.

       -delay=
              in  microseconds.  This  is the time which separate
              the transmission of 2 bytes.  The default value  is
              5  microseconds.  Decrease  this value increase the
              transfer speed but decrease the reliability of  the
              transmission.

       -gray_planes=
              This  value  represent the number of grey scales on
              the TI planar screen. Legal values are: 0 (Black  &
              White),  2 (2 extra colors -> 4 colors), 5 (5 extra
              colors -> 7 colors) or 11 (blurry mode).

       -tick_rate=
              set number the rate of the timer. The 'tickrate' is
              a  measure  of  how often the internal timer of the
              TI89/92/92+ should be increased by one.  Since  the
              screen  is updated every 16th time the timer ticks,
              this value is important for  emulator  performance.
              For  fast  Pentium  (or equivalent processors), you
              should probably leave it at 40000. For slower  Pen-
              tium,  you  should  probably increase this to leave
              more room for the m68k emulation, or, if a game  is
              running  too  slox  you  could try to decrease this
              (which will speed the game up if it is synchronized
              with  the  timer  and  is  not  too CPU-intensive).
              Defaults to 40000 and can be any integer value. The
              higher, the slower.

       -cycle_rate=
              set  the rate of instructions. The 'cyclerate' is a
              measure of how long to delay each m68k  instruction
              beforeproceeding to the next. On slower Pentium (or
              equivalent processors), always set  this  to  0  as
              delay  is  not  necessary.  On faster Pentium , the
              default works pertty fine  (can  be  adjusted  from
              program  to  program  if you want as exact speed as
              possible).  Defaults to 140 and can be any  integer
              value.

       -dark_col=
              set  the  dark  (dark  blue) color to the given RGB
              value (in hex). Format: 0xrrggbb. Default value  is
              0x000034.

       -light_col=
              set  the  dark  (dark  blue) color to the given RGB
              value (in hex). Format: 0xrrggbb. Default value  is
              0x989898.

       -sync_one=
              0  or  1.  Must be an integer boolean value. If you
              set this to 0, scren updating will be  synchronized
              with  the  timer  which  means  it  will  always be
              updated regularly. This may  cause  grayscale  pic-
              tures  to  flicker  when  you  press keys and other
              things happen in the code. If you set  this  to  1,
              scren updating will be synchronized with IRQ1. This
              means that if IRQ1 does not run, the screen is  not
              updated.  This  options  usually  makes  grayscales
              rock-stable, but will not work at all  in  programs
              thqt turn off IRQ1 (like 'tunnel' or 'torus'). This
              options is 0 per default but switching it to  1  is
              usually a good idea when grayscale is involved.

       -background=
              0 or 1. If set to 0, GtkTiEmu will display only the
              calculator LCD. You will not see the  keyboard  but
              popup menu is still accessible.

       filename
              a  ROM file to load at startup, such as 'ti92.rom'.

              cable parameters.

CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This  section describes the format of the .gtktiemu config
       file which is in the home directory of the user (Linux). A
       line  preceded  by the '#' symbol is a comment.  Each line
       has the following format:  option=something.   The  config
       file must have the 'RC_END' string at end.  Every line can
       be put in any order.  Take in mind that any comment  added
       in   the  config  file  will  be  overwritten.   Below  is
       described each option and the possible values:

       calctype= Defines the calculator type. Choose one  of  the
       following value: ti89, ti92, ti92+.

       linktype=  Define  the  link cable type. Choose one of the
       following value: TIGraphLink, parallel,  serial,  AVRlink,
       fastAVRlink,  virtual, TiEmulator, VTi, UsbGraphLink, TiP-
       cUsbLink.

       adr_port= places the I/O address of the I/O port  to  use.
       It  can be 0x3F8 for a serial port or 0x378 for a parallel
       port for instance.

       in the memory box of th debugger window.

       img_format= Defines the image format of  the  screenshots.
       Several  formats  are available: PCX, XPM, JPG or BMP (SDL
       only).

       img_size=  The  size  of  the image that is to say you can
       shots only the LCD or the entire window (skin+LCD).

       screen_file= Defines the base filename where  the  screen-
       shot will be stored.

       screen_counter=  This  allows  you  to  save  the  current
       screenshot counter. In fact,  the  resulting  filename  is
       computed    as   'screenfile[screen_counter].[img_format].
       Example: 'screenshot001.xpm'.

       console= Available under Windows platform  only.  You  can
       hide  or  show  the  console at startup or even display it
       only during boot.

       Think to terminate your config script  with  the  'RC_END'
       word !!!
